# Smithery

Smithery is a custom plugin, inspired by [Smeltery](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/smeltery-free.35784/), that
facilitates the forging of Alloys. This plugin requires [at least] Java 16 and CivModCore to function.

Be aware that Smithery does not dictate how Forges are made nor how Alloys are used. Server admins should use
`/smithery give` to give themselves a Forge so that they can, for example, create a CraftEnhance recipe for it.
Likewise, use `/smithery list` to list all parsed recipes and be able to produce each Alloy at each quality at each
stage.

## Config

[See here](./src/main/resources/config.yml) for how to properly configure your Smithery plugin. Smithery also supports,
*to a certain extent*, Smeltery's 1.4 configuration. [Read more about that here](./SMELTERY.md).
